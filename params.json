  "body": "# Discordoragi\r\nDiscordoragi is a Discord bot based on [Roboragi](http://github.com/Nihilate/Roboragi) which creates anime and manga links from MAL, Hummingbird, Anilist, MangaUpdates and Anime-Planet when requested.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nDiscordoragi is written in Python for use with Python 3.5+ It is not possible to use anything less as the Discord API is phasing out support for it. For more information on installation read the related section [in the README](https://github.com/jwolff52/Discordoragi#installation)\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nDiscordoragi uses discord.py (a Python library) to interface with Discord. It waits for messages from all of the servers it is allowed in and checks each of those for requests for the correct symbols - {}, {{}}, <> and <<>>. Once it's identified that it's being called, it takes the stuff between the braces and does a search for it in various anime/manga databases. Once it's got as much as it can find, the objects generated by the various databases are sent off to be formed into a reply. That then gets sent back to the channel it came from.\r\n\r\n## Current databases\r\n- MAL (Anime + Manga)\r\n- Hummingbird (Anime)\r\n- Anilist (Anime + Manga)\r\n- MangaUpdates (Manga)\r\n- Anime-Planet (Anime + Manga)\r\n",
